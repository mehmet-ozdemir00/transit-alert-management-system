| DELETE | /unsubscribe              | Unsubscribe from transit alerts              |
| GET    | /prediction               | Get predicted transit delays                 |
| GET    | /delay                    | Get current delays for specific routes       |
| GET    | /cancelled                | Get current cancelled for specific routes    |
| OPTIONS| /subscribe, /update,      | CORS support for API calls                   |          
|        | /unsubscribe, /status,    |                                              |

 All endpoints are protected via Amazon API Gateway and secured with Cognito authorizers.


# üîí Security

All sensitive data is securely managed:

* Cognito ensures secure user login and authentication.
* DynamoDB stores user data and subscription logs with encryption at rest.
* Lambda environment variables are used for managing credentials and other sensitive information, never hard-coded in the codebase.
* API Gateway enforces HTTPS for secure data transmission.
* IAM Roles ensure that Lambda functions have the necessary permissions to interact with DynamoDB, SNS, and other AWS services.
* S3 stores Lambda deployment artifacts securely, ensuring that only authorized users can upload and retrieve code packages.
