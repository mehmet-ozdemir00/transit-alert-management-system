# üöè API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint                  | Description                                  |
|--------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| POST   | /subscribe                | Subscribe to transit alerts                  |
| GET    | /status                   | View delay status for your routes            |
| PUT    | /update                   | Update subscription details (e.g., email)    |
| DELETE | /unsubscribe              | Unsubscribe from transit alerts              |
| DELETE | /subscription             | Remove subscription record from DynamoDB     |


 All endpoints are protected via Amazon API Gateway and secured with Cognito authorizers.

# üîí Security

All sensitive data is securely managed:

* DynamoDB stores user data and subscription logs with encryption at rest.
* Lambda environment variables are used for managing credentials and other sensitive information, never hard-coded in the codebase.
* API Gateway enforces HTTPS for secure data transmission.
* IAM Roles ensure that Lambda functions have the necessary permissions to interact with DynamoDB, SNS, and other AWS services.
* S3 stores Lambda deployment artifacts securely, ensuring that only authorized users can upload and retrieve code packages.
